All natural. Naturally brewed. Before modern soft drink, technology existed, non-alcoholic beverages were brewed at home directly from herbs, roots, spices, and fruits. These hand-crafted brews were then aged like wine and prized not only for their taste but for their tonic, health giving properties. Taste the difference brewing makes! Out of a passion for ginger, we have revived a unique ginger ale (beer) brewing process that predates modern soft drink technology. Our ginger ales have won numerous gourmet awards and have been the top selling non-alcoholic beverages in natural and gourmet foods stores nationwide for years. In many cultures, ginger is believed to be an excellent digestive aid, arthritis remedy, motion sickness cure and general all around tonic root. Reeds Extra Ginger Brew recipe is from Jamaica where the art of home brewing ginger ale (or ginger beer as it is called there) is still practiced. Our recipe uses the finest fresh ginger root (26 grams per bottle), exotic spices, honey, pineapple, lemon and lime juices.","origin_name":"","style_name":"","products_id":"3359","products_quantity":"-7","products_price":43.99,"products_image":"http:\/\/beerrightnow.com\/images\/reeds_ginger_beer.jpg","products_ship_price":"0.0000"}],"pagination":{"current_page":1,"total_pages":1}}
